# Cursor Rules for Four-Corners-Stocks Project

This document outlines the preferred workflow and rules for development in this project when using AI assistance through Cursor.

## Development Workflow

1. **Make Local Changes First**

   - All code modifications should be done locally in the workspace
   - The AI should suggest and implement changes to files in the local repository
   - No direct commits or pushes to GitHub without prior local review

2. **Verification and Acceptance**

   - After local changes are made, the user must be given an opportunity to verify and test
   - The AI should wait for explicit confirmation that changes are working as expected
   - Sample output or screenshots may be provided to help with verification

3. **Commit Process**

   - Only commit changes after explicit approval from the user
   - Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commit format
   - Group related changes into a single commit when appropriate

4. **Push to GitHub**
   - Push to GitHub only happens after a commit has been made and approved
   - The user will explicitly request when to push changes
   - After pushing, confirm with the user that the push was successful

## Additional Guidelines

- **File Organization**: Maintain the established project structure
- **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style in the project
- **Documentation**: Update README.md when adding new features
- **Testing**: Allow time for manual testing before committing
- **Iterations**: Make changes iteratively rather than all at once for easier review

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: I want to add a new feature that does X
AI: *Suggests implementation approach*
User: That sounds good, please make the changes
AI: *Makes local changes to relevant files*
AI: Here are the changes I've made. You can test them by...
User: I've tested the changes and they work great
User: Please commit these changes
AI: *Prepares commit with descriptive message*
User: Now please push these changes to GitHub
AI: *Pushes to GitHub and confirms success*
```
